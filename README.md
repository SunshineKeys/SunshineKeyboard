# 🌞 Hi, I'm Megan — Data Analyst

I turn messy data into clear insights and build tools that solve real problems. My work emphasizes clean code, structured analysis, and delivering actionable results—not just pretty charts.

**Current focus:** Transitioning from 7 years in healthcare (Certified Pharmacy Technician) to data analyst roles where I can combine analytical skills, Python proficiency, and healthcare domain expertise.

## 🐍 Previous Work: 8-Day Python Portfolio Sprint

Before diving into data analysis, I built foundational Python skills through an 8-day sprint creating automation tools and utilities:

- **Day 8** — Job Application Tracker (CLI with JSON persistence)
- **Day 7** — Log Analyzer Tool (parsing + severity counting)
- **Day 6** — Task Manager (menu-driven with state management)
- **Day 5** — Expense Tracker (CSV export + data validation)
- **Day 4** — Weather Dashboard (API integration + JSON handling)
- **Day 3** — Password Generator (security tools + validation)
- **Day 2** — File Organizer (automation by file type)
- **Day 1** — Text Analyzer CLI (statistics + reading time)

## 🎯 Why I'm Different

Most career changers talk about wanting to learn. **I'm already doing the work.**

- Instead of saying "I want to learn data analysis" → **I built 3 data analysis projects in 3 days**
- Instead of saying "I'm detail-oriented" → **I spent 7 years in pharmacy where data errors cost lives**
- Instead of saying "I can learn quickly" → **I taught myself pandas, SQL operations, and visualization in one week**

I don't just want a job in data. I want to solve business problems with analysis every day.

## 🌟 A Note About My Journey

I spent 7 years as a Pharmacy Technician because I'm good at working with data, following processes, and catching errors before they become problems. Those skills don't disappear when you change industries—they just find new applications.

Pharmacy taught me:
- **Attention to detail** (mistakes had serious consequences)
- **Data accuracy** (processing prescriptions with 99%+ accuracy)
- **System thinking** (understanding complex healthcare workflows)
- **Regulatory compliance** (HIPAA, DEA, state board requirements)
- **Working under pressure** (high-volume environments with zero error tolerance)

Now I'm applying those same skills to data analysis. Same precision, different domain.

Thanks for checking out my work. If you're hiring for entry-level data analyst roles—especially in healthcare—I'd love to connect.
